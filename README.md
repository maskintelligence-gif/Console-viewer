# 🚀 Console Viewer Pro

Console Viewer Pro is a powerful, real-time web application that allows developers to scan any public URL and instantly view its console logs, network activity, and a visual snapshot. It acts as a remote, shareable Chrome DevTools environment.

Built with **React**, **Node.js**, **Socket.IO**, and **Puppeteer**.

## ✨ Features & Functionality

The application is divided into four main tabs, each offering specific debugging tools:

### 1. 💻 Console Tab
Streams real-time console output from the target website.
* **Live Streaming:** Logs appear instantly as the headless browser navigates the page.
* **Smart Filtering:** Filter logs by type (`All`, `Errors`, `Warnings`, `Info`).
* **Text Search:** Instantly search through logs and their arguments (case-insensitive).
* **1-Click Bug Reports:** Hover over any log and click the "Bug" icon to instantly copy a Markdown-formatted bug report (including URL, timestamp, and error details) to your clipboard.
* **Exporting:** Copy individual logs, copy all logs, or download the entire console session as a `.json` file.
* **Virtualization:** Uses `react-virtuoso` to smoothly render thousands of logs without freezing the browser.

### 2. 🌐 Network Tab
Monitors all HTTP traffic generated by the target website.
* **Traffic Logging:** Captures all requests (XHR, Fetch, Scripts, Images, etc.).
* **Failure Highlighting:** Automatically highlights failed requests (e.g., 404s, 500s, CORS errors, or blocked requests) in red.
* **Details:** Displays the HTTP Status Code, Method (GET/POST), Resource Type, and the full URL.

### 3. 📸 Snapshot Tab
Captures exactly what the page looked like when the scan occurred.
* **Full-Page Screenshot:** A high-quality image captured by Puppeteer.
* **Full Preview:** Click the image or the "Full Preview" button to open a dimmed, full-screen modal for detailed inspection.
* **Download:** Save the snapshot directly to your local machine as a `.png`.
* **Social Share:** Uses the native Web Share API to instantly send the image via Slack, Discord, Messages, or Email (on supported browsers/devices).

### 4. 🕰️ History Tab
Never lose a debugging session.
* **Automatic Saving:** Every scan is automatically saved to a local SQLite database (`scans.db`).
* **Session Overview:** View past scans, their timestamps, and a quick count of how many Errors and Warnings occurred.
* **1-Click Reload:** Click "Load Scan" on any historical entry to instantly repopulate the Console, Network, and Snapshot tabs with that exact past state.

## ⚙️ How It Works (Architecture)

1. **The Request:** The user enters a URL in the React frontend and clicks "Run Scan".
2. **WebSocket Connection:** The frontend establishes a real-time Socket.IO connection with the Express backend.
3. **Headless Browsing:** The Node.js server launches a hidden Google Chrome instance using **Puppeteer**.
4. **Interception:** Puppeteer navigates to the requested URL and attaches listeners to the page's console and network events.
5. **Real-Time Streaming:** As the page loads, logs and network requests are streamed back to the React frontend via WebSockets and displayed instantly.
6. **Finalization:** Once the page finishes loading, Puppeteer takes a screenshot, saves all the data to the SQLite database, and closes the browser.

## 🛡️ Security & Production Readiness

This application is built to be deployed safely on the public internet:
* **Socket Rate Limiting:** Users are strictly limited to **5 scans per minute** per IP address to prevent CPU exhaustion and DDoS attacks.
* **API Rate Limiting:** Standard REST endpoints are protected by `express-rate-limit`.
* **Dockerized:** Includes a production-ready `Dockerfile` that automatically installs Google Chrome and all required Linux fonts/libraries so Puppeteer can run flawlessly on platforms like Render, Railway, or DigitalOcean.
* **Memory Management:** Puppeteer is configured with `--disable-dev-shm-usage` and `--disable-gpu` to prevent memory crashes in containerized environments.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** React 19, Vite, Tailwind CSS v4, Lucide Icons, Framer Motion, React Virtuoso.
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express, Socket.IO.
* **Browser Automation:** Puppeteer.
* **Database:** SQLite (`better-sqlite3`).
